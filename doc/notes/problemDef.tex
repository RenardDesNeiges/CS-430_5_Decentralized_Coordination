\subsection{General problem description}

Our goal is to maximize our profit margin $M_p$ over all $n$ elements in the set $T$ of all $t_i$ auctions. Where $r(t_i)$ is the revenue from an auction ($r(t_i)=0$ of if the auction is lost) and $c(t_i)$ is the cost that carrying out an auctioned contract ($r(t_i)=0$ of if the auction is lost). In an adversarial setting where the contract is awarded to the lowest bidding agent $a$ (\textit{closed-bid first-price reverse auction}). Where $a\in A$ the set of all agents in the game. Our own agent is denoted as $\alpha \in A$.

\begin{align}
    M_p = \sum_{t_i \in T} r(t_i) - \sum_{t_i \in T} c(t_i)
\end{align}

At each step $i$ our profit margin varies by a values $\Delta M_p(i)$ :

\begin{align}
    \Delta M_p(i) = r(t_i) - c(t_i)
\end{align}

For a given \textit{task} our decision algorithm has the following informations : 
\begin{align*}
    \text{Cost of adding a given task to the plan : } && c(t_i) && \forall t_i \\
    \text{Price offered by every agent for previous bids : } && p(t_i,a) && \forall t_i,a\\
    \text{Cost of carrying out auction for previous bids : } && c(i) && \forall i \\
    \text{Winner of a given bid : } && w(i) && \forall i
\end{align*}

The problem can essentially be thought of as a \textit{multi-armed bandit} problem with an exploration/exploitation tradeoff, we will use a variation on \textit{Thomson Sampling}. The general idea is to fit a probability distribution to estimate our winning probability at each bid. And then pick a bidding amount from that probability distribution in such a way that our expected winning value $\mathbb{E}\left(\Delta M_p(i)\right)$ is maximal (greedy algorithm). Or to pick a value at random out of a distribution constructed in such a way that our expected winning value is maximized over time but we don't give up on exploration, which actually tends to yield better results than the greedy solution (\textit{Thomson Sampling}).

\section{Defining error}

We define the error made for a given auction as follows :
\begin{align}
    e(i) = \min_{\forall a \in A/Â \alpha} \left\lbrace p(t_i,a) \right\rbrace - p(t_i,\alpha) 
\end{align}

For auctions that our agent won we have $e(i_{won})\geq 0$, for auctions lost we have $e(i_{won})\leq 0$.
